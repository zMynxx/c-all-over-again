# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "app".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  app:
    image: druxx/ubuntu-ceedling:22.04-v0.31.1
    platform: linux/amd64
    build:

    # If your application exposes a port, uncomment the following lines and change
    # the port numbers as needed. The first number is the host port and the second
    # is the port inside the container.
    # ports:
    #   - 8080:8080
